Released in early 2012, Microsoft Flight is a follow up to the discontinued Microsoft Flight Simulator series. With new game modes and an overhaul of the controls, Microsoft Studios were hoping the game would be more accessible to new players, while still maintaining the realism that had appealed to hardcore flying enthusiasts. Microsoft Flight is an aviation game from Microsoft Studios created as a successor to the discontinued Microsoft Flight Simulator series. The game is offered "free-to-play"; charging gamers for downloading extra content, aircraft or scenery. In July 2012, Microsoft ceased development of the game permanently to re-align its "long-term goals and development plans.". The Flight Community Team was able to support the game and the dedicated players who continued logging hours of virtual flight time over the years. However from time to time, Microsoft Studios has to revise our portfolio, taking into consideration multiple factors regarding the continuation of support for a title.

So I have a television (ELEFW3828R 32') and a monitor hooked up to my GPU which is a GTX 1060 3GB. The Monitor is an HDMI to HDMI connection and the TV is an HDMI(TV) to a DVI-I(PC). Whenever I load up Microsoft Flight simulator with my multiple monitors, the TV changes its resolution from 1920x1080 (which is it's native resolution) to 1366\ 768. I went to advanced scaling setting and turned the windows auto focus feature off (although I didn't really think that would help) and whenever Is it possible to play this game on Linux. 
I got a new computer about 6 months ago and decided to try and get back into this game. When I start it up on steam it works fine, I can choose what mission I want and what plane I want ect. But once I click "fly now" Im treated with a black screen and the game music playing. At first I thought that it just did that for 10-20 seconds while it loaded but I left it for like 10 minutes and nothing happening Never used this sub and I dont know I can ask this here. Ill delete Haven't done a trade on here before, but have done physical trades on subs like r/hardwareswap and others. Leave a comment Hi, I work on C-17s and was looking into flight sims. I stumbled upon the C-17 DLC and it made me want to try and get into flight sim, and I thought why not use the C-17 as I'm already quite familiar with the jet, and there's even a skin for the unit/base I work at on the tail - a silly reason but it is what made me really want to try it haha. I know the game is already quite cheap, but I was wondering if it is worth waiting for it to go on sale at some point (if it even ever goes on sale)?. https://store.steampowered.com/app/314160/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_X_Steam_Edition/ My buddy just needs a build to play this game optimally. Any ideas. Hi, This is my first post to this subreddit, so I'm not entirely sure how it all works. As far as I can tell, you give a good reason for why you want the game, and if you're lucky, some incredibly nice person comes along and gives it to you. All that being said, the game I want is Microsoft Flight Simulator X. I am currently in high school, and am very interested in aeronautical engineering, and astrodynamics. I have over 100 hours on one of my favorite games, Kerbal Space Program. I recently. </p>
