                            <p>Let me start by saying this computer cannot be upgraded to another SP or OS. A 10 TB was installed in the computer but disk management only shows able to format 1TB of it. In disk part it shows the disk size as the full 10 TB but won't let me format the drive that big. Am I stuck with only using. Hey people. So my main computer's PSU bit the dust, and I've been relegated to an oldschool laptop for the time being. I've installed all necessary drivers, and the system is as up to date as it can be. While connecting with either an ethernet cable or through WiFi the connection cuts out and needs to be repaired or reset every 10~ minutes or so. Here is a screenshot of my ipconfig when the connection is running well, I'll post another screenshot if it's any different when the connection. My secondary HD started to toss and turn after zipping something, and I was using it for boot. It no longer boots the os, gives me cannot find boot device. My other drive boots the os but some folders in my secondary drive, the aforementioned one and telling me that I cannot access them with my user. I tried changes all of them to open share with my current user. As admin and allowed for sharing. No luck. Makes no sense as the data is still there but the folders read as 0 bites. All my downlo. Hello, I have a problem with one of my computers running Windows XP Service Pack 3. Every time it is turned on, it eventually will blue screen after 1-5 minutes. One the BSOD does occur, I get the Memory Management error with the code 0x0000001A. I can boot into Safe Mode, where the problem no longer occurs. I read about running Memtest86+, and have been for the past few hours, but no failures yet. Any suggestions on what could be the problem, and how to fix them, would be greatly appreciat. I heard many of you are hoarding "Linux isos", so I thought someone might have a Windows XP SP 2 64-bit GERMAN iso. I can't seem to find one anywhere on the internet, only SP 3 or in English. I need it for my father to run an old piece of software that only works on SP2, and he can't speak English. If anyone of you was able to provide on for me, I'd be more than thankful.

I had 4gb and PoE and Fortuna were basically unplayable because the game was always freezing since the ram wasn't enough and the game put some of the archives on HDD (which is slower). In my childhood, I'm very much good with Windows 95, 98 and later on continued to 2000, XP, 7, 8 and now 10. When I'm using Windows XP SP 3, I come across Ubuntu in a local Telugu language newspaper and found it interesting. At that time Canonical supplied free CD's through post and I ordered a one, installed and found it really hard (I'm around 14 at that time). Now after a long gap, Installed Ubuntu 18.04 and been using it since last two months (formatted Windows). I frequently use Adobe. I'm running Windows 10. When I start the game, as it's running through the load up screens before the main menu, I can hear the sounds but only get a black screen. I've run compatibility modes in Windows XP SP 1, 2, 3, and Windows 7--still doesn't fix the issue. Note: Once the game loads up the main menu, everything 
I recently repaired a pretty ancient laptop (lt 1GB RAM, 1.6 GHz CPU, \~ 50 GB HDD, Windows XP SP 3) for my father. Despite me telling him that this laptop is not properly suited for drawing (besides paint) he still insists that he wants to use drawing software (i.e. such as AutoCAD) on it. Are there any such programs that exist. I am looking for a version 4.3 or older to virtualize a Windows XP sp 2 machine. Any help would be amazing. So I've recently got hit with the Fallout bug. Installed 3, New Vegas, and 4. NV and 4 work fine on Windows 10 (albeit some performance mods and tweaking for NV). However, 3 is giving me issues. Before you link me to a site that gives commonly known fixes, know that I've done all of them. Or at least the ones specified in the guides in the Reddit Fallout Community. I've even ran both the Fallout Launcher and Fallout 3.exe files as Windows XP SP 2 and 3, Vista, and 7.

I am currently looking for some good games ( any genres are ok, as long it is good ). But my PC is quite crappy, it is 14 years old.

The printer in the kitchen is not working. It has not worked for a week. I can ping the printer using the router software. The printer does not show up at all in network printers. The Epson TM-U200 has a Dlink DP-301P+ Ethernet printer port attached. I can't get into the interface of the DP 301P. The network port in the back lights up. Both computers are running Windows XP SP 3. I tried turning the firewall to low and set up a DMZ up on the IP address.

I just wanna So my friend recommended me this game to play because I was bored and needed some mindless sci-fi action in my life. So I downloaded Warframe from Steam and tried playing it. Probably the worst FPS I've ever had for a game (around 25fps in secluded places and 15fps in texture filled places. This is with everything set to lowest). Now my laptop isn't the a massive workhorse, I got it in 2012 and it has a pretty weak graphics card. But according to the Steam page, Warframe should So I'm going to skip the long story as to why I need this done, and just explain the situation. I need to put a new hard drive into my Windows XP desktop, but I'm not sure what to do to transfer the OS over. I'm not worried about personal files or programs or anything because that's backed up, I just need to have the OS on the new hard drive. What's the best way to go about this? So far I haven't tried anything myself because I'm not sure where to start. Specs: Windows XP SP 3 AMD Athlon Hey friendlies, I'm trying to get this fantastic game up and running again. Here's the situation: -system: windows 10 -Installed EVN (haven't entered the registration code yet) -try running, error: "requires quicktime v5.0 or higher" -install Quicktime -try running, error: "sorry, EV must run in 256 or thousands of colors" -Set compatability to Windows XP SP 2, colors to 256 -try running, error: "requires quicktime v5.0 or higher."

I used to have Darkest Hour, and I remember it running fine. I don't remember if I changed settings or not, or which ones I changed. That was windows 8.1. Now I just got it again and it wont launch in windows 10. Every time I start it it goes to the loading screen, the game loads until the loading bar is full, and then another window pops up telling me that the game isn't responding. Even if I wait a few minutes, the game doesn't continue past the loading screen. What I've tried I'm sorry in advance for this post as I know how many people ask this sort of stuff but I'm clueless. I completely uninstalled Oblivion, deleted every trace of it, reinstalled it, started a new game and played through the intro until I exited the sewers. I then saved my game and quit. Then, when I want to load that exact same save, it crashes instantly. I get one glimpse of the loading screen and then I'm greeted by a black screen and a message saying Oblivion has stopped working. I don't. 
Windows Host trying to run a VM with Kali Linux and Windows XP SP 2. Both of my VMs are getting the 10.x.x.x IPs and not 192.x.x.x. I'm trying to practice some pentesting, need some help configuring the Network part of Oracle VM. I've read several different things and that's why I'm confused </p>
